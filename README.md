# File Archive Manager (FAM)

**FAM** is a tool for organising and enriching your file collection.  
It helps you keep your files safe, searchable, and easy to browse — while your original files remain untouched.

---

## Features

**Date Management:**

- Photos store three ISO 8601 timestamp fields: `dateTaken`, `dateAdded`, `dateModified`
- **Date precision tracking**: `dateTakenPrecision` field indicates confidence level
  - `'exact'`: From EXIF data or known exact time
  - `'day'`: Know the exact day but not the time
  - `'month'`: Know month and year but not day
  - `'year'`: Only know the year
  - `'decade'`: Best guess within a decade (e.g., "1980s")
  - `'unknown'`: Complete guess/placeholder
- Easy searching by date range or year with string comparison
- User-friendly date formatting with precision indicators (e.g., "1985 (est.)", "1980s (est.)")
- Chronological sorting capabilities
- Helper functions for creating estimated dates

_(more features to be added as the project develops)_

### Date Format Decision (2025-09-07)

**Question:** "What dates would you receommend we store and what forat? We want easy searching and good user readability"

**Decision:** Store dates as ISO 8601 strings (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`)
**Rationale:**

- ✅ Easy searching: String comparison works for date ranges
- ✅ User readable: Human-interpretable format
- ✅ TypeScript/JSON native compatibility
- ✅ Timezone aware (UTC timestamps)
- ✅ Sortable: Lexicographic = chronological order

**Date Fields Added:**

- `dateTaken`: When photo was captured (primary for user UX)
- `dateAdded`: When added to archive (import tracking)
- `dateModified`: When metadata last updated (sync/backup)

**Utility Functions Created:**

**Utility Functions Created:**

- `findByDateRange()`, `findByYear()` - Search by date
- `formatDateForDisplay()` - Locale-aware formatting with precision indicators
- `sortByDateTaken()` - Chronological sorting
- `createEstimatedDate()`, `createDecadeEstimate()` - Generate estimated dates
- `filterByPrecision()` - Filter photos by date confidence level

### Date Precision Enhancement (2025-09-07)

**Question:** "If we are adding old photos we may not have the data (or even year) the photo was taken. How can we indicate that the datetaken is an estimate?"

**Solution:** Added `DatePrecision` type and `dateTakenPrecision` field
**Approach:**

- Added 6 precision levels: `exact`, `day`, `month`, `year`, `decade`, `unknown`
- Enhanced display formatting to show estimation indicators
- Maintained ISO 8601 date format for consistency and searchability
- Created helper functions for generating reasonable estimated dates (mid-year, mid-decade defaults)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clear indication of date reliability in UI
- ✅ Maintains searchable date format
- ✅ Graceful handling of incomplete information
- ✅ Future-proof for AI-assisted date estimation

### Image Display Implementation Complete (2025-09-08)

**Request:** "how do i make the images on the backend visible on the front end?"

**Solution Applied:** Added static file serving to backend and updated frontend image URLs
**Achievements:**

- ✅ Backend now serves static images via `/api/images/<filename>` endpoint
- ✅ Frontend updated to use actual image files instead of placeholder service
- ✅ Express static middleware configured for `backend/src/data/test-images` directory
- ✅ All 8 sample images now displaying correctly in photo grid
- ✅ Proper CORS and proxy configuration maintained
- ✅ No performance impact - images served efficiently by Express

**Technical Changes:**

**Status:** ✅ Frontend successfully displaying all actual photo files from backend storage

### Comprehensive Metadata Extraction Implementation (2025-09-09)

**Request:** "can we add the meta data to a new structure called meta data and asve all the meta data found?"

**Solution Applied:** Enhanced metadata extraction with comprehensive EXIF data storage in dedicated metadata structure
**Achievements:**

- ✅ New `Metadata` type structure for storing all raw metadata
- ✅ Comprehensive EXIF data extraction using `exifr` library
- ✅ Structured metadata storage with organized categories:
  - **exif**: Raw EXIF data from image files
  - **file**: File system information (size, dates, format, MIME type)
  - **technical**: Image specifications (color space, orientation, resolution, compression)
  - **gps**: Location data (coordinates, altitude, direction, timestamp)
  - **camera**: Camera settings (make, model, lens, focal length, aperture, ISO, flash, etc.)
  - **timestamps**: All date/time fields from various sources
  - **processing**: Extraction metadata (when extracted, tool version, source)
- ✅ Two API endpoints for metadata extraction:
  - `POST /api/photos/extract-metadata` - Extract from single image
  - `POST /api/photos/extract-all-metadata` - Batch process all images
- ✅ Preserves existing manual data while updating with extracted metadata
- ✅ Fallback handling for images without EXIF data
- ✅ TypeScript types synchronized between frontend and backend

**Technical Implementation:**

- Added comprehensive EXIF parsing with full metadata retention
- File system stat integration for creation/modification dates
- GPS coordinate extraction and formatting
- Camera settings extraction (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, lens info)
- Processing provenance tracking
- Atomic write operations for data safety
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**API Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Extract metadata from single image
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/photos/extract-metadata \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "IMG_2119.jpeg"}'

# Extract metadata from all images
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/photos/extract-all-metadata \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete metadata extraction and storage system with comprehensive EXIF data preservation

---

**Prompt Log:**

- 2025-09-08: "how do i make the images on the backend visible on the front end?" - Solution: Added Express static file serving for images directory and updated frontend image URLs
- 2025-09-09: "can we add the meta data to a new structure called meta data and asve all the meta data found?" - Solution: Enhanced metadata extraction with comprehensive EXIF data storage in dedicated metadata structure
- 2025-09-09: "I do not wish to save the following meta data MediaWhitePoint RedMatrixColumn..." - Solution: Added metadata filtering to exclude color profile and technical fields
- 2025-09-09: "It looks like the tags in sample.json have been replaced with meta data" - Solution: Fixed metadata extraction logic to preserve meaningful tags instead of replacing them with camera metadata. Removed camera tag generation from extraction function since camera info is now properly stored in metadata.camera structure
